     Very basic search that looks for any resource that matches the given object - that is, has fields that match the given JSON object. There's no special logic here, and everything has to be an exact match.

     This is **not** designed to be well optimized! It operates at O(n) speed. If there are a ton of resources, a better searching mechanism should be used. This will likely not be changed any time in the future.
